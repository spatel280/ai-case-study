[^1]: "Tome | Company Overview & News." Forbes, 2023, https://www.forbes.com/companies/tome/?list=ai50&sh=5cd50a7c2f06.


* Who are the founders of the company?
  - Keith Peiris and Henri Liriani [^1]

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  - Tome was inspired by two factors: [^2]
    1. **Lack of dynamic capabilities from current product offerings** - *Both founders were frustrated with PowerPoint and Google Slides for their lack of good mobile integration, inability to include dynamic images of prototypes, customer data, or other artifacts*
    2. **Advent of readily-accessible LLMs** - *Development of OpenAI's GPT series inspired the founders to develop a tool that could do for pitch decks what ChatGPT had done for text prompts*

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  - In February 2023, Tome raised $43 million in a Series B funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners along with a bevy of other investors including Coatue, Greylock, Stability.ai CEO Emad Mostaque, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The round values Tome at $300 million post-investment, up from $175 million at its 2021 Series A round. The company has done all this without making a single dollar in sales. [^2]

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  - Tome is a storytelling and presentation tool that uses AI to rethink the traditional way of creating presentations and telling stories. Using a prompt, Tome allows users to generate a presentation organized by a table of contents, including text, introduction slides, and AI-generated images. Tome’s aesthetics utilize a different style compared to typical PowerPoint or Google Slides presentations. [^3]
  - Tome can be a useful tool for brainstorming and slide development, minimizing the need for users to come up with their own ideas and templates when using typical presentation software. [^4]
  > ***Even if you're an experienced practicioner of storytelling, that's a helpful construct.***

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  - The [Tome website](https://tome.app/) indicates that the tool could be utilized by six various groups:
    1. **Founders & Startups**
    2. **Creators & Freelancers**
    3. **Marketers**
    4. **Sales Teams**
    5. **Product Teams**
    6. **Education Teams or Students**

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  - Two key factors distinguish Tome from its comeptitors: [^4]
    + **Enhanced AI functionality** - *Tome build its service offering around generative AI from the beginning, which should provide it an edge against incumbents; the company has also hired a lot of AI talent from key tech firms such as Facebook, Robinhood, and Google*
    + **Younger user base** - *Accounting for one-third of its users, Gen Z users don't have the ingrained habits of using PowerPoint over multiple years, which facilitates their transition towards using newer technologies such as Tome for website designs, resumes, and presentations*

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
  - Tome has extensive integrations with apps like Figma, Looker, Framer, Giphy, YouTube, and others, as well as a modern tech stack that is ideal for leveraging large AI models, or building its own. [^5]
  - Tome's artificial intelligence also utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 technology. [^6]

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
  - Corporate productivity and marketing suites

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
  - Maybe unsurprisingly, there have been minimal innovations in this presentation / storytelling industry. Microsoft has kept PowerPoint fairly stable throughout its 30+ years of dominance due to its very large user base. Google had an initial lead in AI development, but did not fully take advantage of that position to push Slides to the forefront over its 15-year existence. [^2]

* What are the other major companies in this field?
  - There are four other key players in this field: [^3]
    1. **Plus AI** – *an AI-based Google Slides presentation maker for professional presentations*
    2. **Gamma** - *a Tome alternative for polished, professional templates*
    3. **Simplified.com** – *a Tome alternative that goes beyond presentations*
    4. **Canva Magic Design** – *a Tome alternative for users that want more colorful designs*
  - In addition, the existing Big Tech firms, such as Google and Microsoft, also compete in this arena.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  - The company has already amassed 10 million sign-ups in just over nine months. [^4]
  - Other companies have already begun using Tome to develop presentation materials, such as sales decks and visual blog posts. One company in particular, Supernormal, used this software to develop a pitch deck to raise funding rounds for its own startup. [^2]

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
