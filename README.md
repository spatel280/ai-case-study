  - Tome was inspired by two factors: [^2]
    1. **Lack of dynamic capabilities from current product offerings** - *Both founders were frustrated with PowerPoint and Google Slides for their lack of good mobile integration, inability to include dynamic images of prototypes, customer data, or other artifacts*
    2. **Advent of readily-accessible LLMs** - *Development of OpenAI's GPT series inspired the founders to develop a tool that could do for pitch decks what ChatGPT had done for text prompts*

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  - In February 2023, Tome raised $43 million in a Series B funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners along with a bevy of other investors including Coatue, Greylock, Stability.ai CEO Emad Mostaque, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The round values Tome at $300 million post-investment, up from $175 million at its 2021 Series A round. The company has done all this without making a single dollar in sales. [^2]

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  - Tome is a storytelling and presentation tool that uses AI to rethink the traditional way of creating presentations and telling stories. Using a prompt, Tome allows users to generate a presentation organized by a table of contents, including text, introduction slides, and AI-generated images. Tome’s aesthetics utilize a different style compared to typical PowerPoint or Google Slides presentations. [^3]
  - Tome can be a useful tool for brainstorming and slide development, minimizing the need for users to come up with their own ideas and templates when using typical presentation software. [^4]
  > ***Even if you're an experienced practicioner of storytelling, that's a helpful construct.***

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  - CEO Peiris indicates that Tome is intended for startup founders, sales people, and college students among others [^4]

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  - Two key factors distinguish Tome from its comeptitors: [^4]
    + **Enhanced AI functionality** - *Tome build its service offering around generative AI from the beginning, which should provide it an edge against incumbents; the company has also hired a lot of AI talent from key tech firms such as Facebook, Robinhood, and Google*
    + **Younger user base** - *Accounting for one-third of its users, Gen Z users don't have the ingrained habits of using PowerPoint over multiple years, which facilitates their transition towards using newer technologies such as Tome for website designs, resumes, and presentations*

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
