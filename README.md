## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
  - Tome

* When was the company incorporated?
  - 2020 [^1]
[^1]: "Tome | Company Overview & News." Forbes, 2023, https://www.forbes.com/companies/tome/?list=ai50&sh=5cd50a7c2f06.


* Who are the founders of the company?
  - Keith Peiris and Henri Liriani [^1]

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  - Tome was inspired by two factors: [^2]
    1. **Lack of dynamic capabilities from current product offerings** - *Both founders were frustrated with PowerPoint and Google Slides for their lack of good mobile integration and their inability to include dynamic images of prototypes, customer data, or other artifacts*.
    2. **Advent of readily-accessible LLMs** - *Development of OpenAI's GPT series inspired the founders to construct a tool that could do for pitch decks what ChatGPT had done for text prompts*.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  - In February 2023, Tome raised $43 million in a Series B funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners along with a bevy of other investors including Coatue, Greylock, Stability.ai CEO Emad Mostaque, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The round values Tome at $300 million post-investment, up from $175 million at its 2021 Series A round. The company has done all this without making a single dollar in sales (at the time of funding). [^2]


## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  - Tome is a productivity tool that uses AI to rethink the traditional way of creating presentations and telling stories. Using a prompt, Tome allows users to generate a presentation organized by a table of contents, including text, introduction slides, and AI-generated images. Tome’s aesthetics utilize a different style compared to typical PowerPoint or Google Slides presentations. [^3]
  - Tome can be a useful tool for brainstorming and slide development, minimizing the need for users to come up with their own ideas and templates when using traditional presentation software. [^4]

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  - The [Tome website](https://tome.app/) indicates that the tool could be utilized by six various groups:
    1. **Founders & Startups**
    2. **Creators & Freelancers**
    3. **Marketers**
    4. **Sales Teams**
    5. **Product Teams**
    6. **Education Teams or Students**
  - Unfortunately, no information was provided that broke down the market size of each of their target demographics.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  - Two key factors distinguish Tome from its comeptitors: [^4]
    + **Enhanced AI functionality** - *Tome built its service offering around generative AI from the beginning, which should provide it a competitive edge vis-a-vis the incumbents; the company has also hired a plethora of AI talent from key tech firms such as Facebook, Robinhood, and Google*.
    + **Younger user base** - *Accounting for one-third of Tome's users, Gen Z customers don't have the ingrained habits of using PowerPoint over decades, which facilitates their transition towards using newer technologies such as Tome for website designs, resumes, and presentations*.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
  - Tome has extensive integrations with apps like Figma, Looker, Framer, Giphy, YouTube, and others, as well as a modern tech stack that is ideal for leveraging large AI models (or building its own). [^5]
  - Tome's artificial intelligence also utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 technology. [^6]

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
  - Corporate productivity / marketing tools

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
  - Maybe unsurprisingly, there have been minimal innovations in this presentation / storytelling industry. Microsoft has kept PowerPoint fairly stable throughout its 30+ years of dominance due to its very large user base. Google had an initial lead in AI development, but did not fully take advantage of that position to push Slides to the forefront over its 15-year existence. [^2]

* What are the other major companies in this field?
  - There are four other key niche players in this field: [^3]
    1. **Plus AI** – *an AI-based Google Slides presentation maker for professional presentations*
    2. **Gamma** - *a Tome alternative for polished, professional templates*
    3. **Simplified.com** – *a Tome alternative that goes beyond presentations*
    4. **Canva Magic Design** – *a Tome alternative for users that want more colorful designs*
  - In addition, the existing Big Tech firms, such as Google and Microsoft, also compete in this arena.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
  - Typical business metrics for early-stage startups include number of monthly users, amount of funding raised, and AI accuracy and precision.
  - Nine months after its release, Tome had already amassed 10 million sign-ups. [^4]
  > ***Now (as of Feb. 2022) valued at $300 million while still pre-revenue...Tome says it’s the fastest productivity software maker to ever reach 1 million users since its September (2022) release (134 days after launch).*** [^2]
  - Other companies have already begun using Tome to develop presentation materials, such as sales decks and visual blog posts. One company in particular, Supernormal, used this software to develop a pitch deck to raise funding rounds for its own startup. [^2]

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
  - Tome seems to be a leading company in this particular AI space, with sizable projected revenue, employee growth, funding levels, and company valuation. [^7]

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  - Tome could expand its education customer base by marketing to teenagers and children, allowing them to learn more about the world via visual exploration. Similar to ChatGPT, kids could ask Tome to build a visual story based on requested inputs, to explain a concept visually using textbook definitions, or draw up diagrams for set plays used in their sports competitions.
  - For more professional use cases, Tome could partner with famous design teams (e.g., painters, sculptors, architects, etc.) to develop better visual training sets and samples that could be integrated into their product outputs.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  - Providing these offerings would enable people without the necessary "creative" sense to take their idea and progress it further in development. It would facilitate learning, teaching, and teaming. How many times have we tried to express an idea that we have visually developed in our minds but are unable to explain verbally or quickly on paper? These kind of solutions would solve that for many folks, thus greatly expanding the customer base for Tome.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  - Their existing technologies should be adequate enough to provide the offerings I've mentioned - the key area of difference would be the data utilized to train the AI. Adding more data (especially copyrighted works from other designers) would enable the AI to produce an expanded set of options and use cases.
